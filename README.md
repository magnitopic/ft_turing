Turing is the father of computer science. He was a British mathematician, logician, and cryptanalyst. He was highly influential in the development of theoretical computer science, providing a formalisation of the concepts of algorithm and computation with the Turing machine, which can be considered a model of a general-purpose computer.

## Turing machines

The Turing machine is a mathematical model fairly easy to understand and to implement. It consists of an infinite tape, a head that reads and writes symbols on the tape, and a set of states.

With this simple model, it is possible to simulate any algorithm that can be executed by a computer. And in this project you will implement your own Turing machine.
